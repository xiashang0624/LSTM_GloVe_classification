Here we build a LSTM classification model with Glovec embedding to predict whether a Stack Exchange answer will be accepted or not.

To use the pre-trained model, make sure you have the the following files in the current directory:

**model.h5** This file contains the pretrained weights for the LSTM DNN model.
**tokenizer.pickle** This file contains the embedding information and the tokenizer obtained during the  model training procss.
